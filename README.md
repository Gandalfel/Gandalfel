# Hi, I'm Jacob
I'm 17 yrs creative hobbist coder. I write in Java for around 3 years. Other technologies with I've worked are SQL, Postgres, JavaFX, JS, CSS, HTML. 
Things I'm good at are Java and Spring Boot. Other I know cursorily, more or less. In the near future I will start learn frontend techcs (JS, CSS && HTML).

## Currently I work on
- backend side of <a href="https://github.com/Gandalfel/toucan">my Spring Boot project</a> *(major assumptions: web app for work with notes, accounts, database, good security management)* 
- ~~frontend side of higher mentioned project~~
